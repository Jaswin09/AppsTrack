We the Peak Performers have made a microblogging mobile UI.
The app has been named Appstract. We have included several features of figma which we will describe in parts.
	We first have a login page which will guide us to the home page. In the home page we have features like horizontal and vertical scrolling. We have added feature of displaying stories which works on tap and is moved around using drag overlay.
We have a task bar which guides us to other pages like messages, profile, settings , discover .In the message page we have several listed contacts which can be viewed in two ways.
1) We can click on the names and text them.
2) We can click on the pictures and view their profiles (overlay ,navigate and swapped with used)
We have included themes and pictures in discover page which can navigate us to other pages.
We have a profile page that displays user info.
In the settings page we have details of the developers.
We have used logout and back buttons to complete the UI and we also have added gifs and heart like buttons to make it more interactive for the user.
WE HOPE YOU WOULD LIKE OUR UI.
